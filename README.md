# Workflowr presentations

Do you need to create slides on workflowr for an upcoming presentation? This
repository is for you!

First, thanks for sharing workflowr with your colleagues. Second, below are
various resources you can adapt and reuse for your presentations.

## General notes

### License requirements

I usually release my content with the permissive Creative Commons Attribution
Internal Public License ([CC-BY][]). This gives you lots of freedom. You can
adapt and reuse as you like. The main requirement is that you attribute my
content as the original source.

### Icons from the Noun Project

Recently I have been using icons provided by the [Noun
Project](https://thenounproject.com/). These are also licensed with [CC-BY][],
and thus must be attributed. My strategy is to have a slide at the end of the
presentation that includes all the icons with their attributions. On any slide
that uses an icon, I insert a link to this attribution slide. If you use only a
few slides from one of my presentations, you can also copy the attribution
slide, and then remove any of the icons you didn't include.

### Hex sticker and logos

If you're looking for the hex sticker or logos, you can find these in the
separate repository [workflowr-assets](https://github.com/workflowr/workflowr-assets).
It contains the logos in various styles and in multiple file formats.

### Stanford STATS 352

I was invited by [Balasubramanian Narasimhan][naras] to give two guest lectures
on reproducible research and workflowr for the course [STATS 352][stats352],
_Topics in Computing for Data Science_, a survey course he co-teaches with John
Chambers.

The first lecture was essentially a remix of my [previous
presentation](#why-r-webinar) for the Why R? webinar series. I added some extra
background slides to the introduction about the lack of computational
reproducibility of published scientific articles. I also added the slides on
[workflowr.io][wio] from my [previous
presentation](#toronto-workshop-on-reproducibility) at the Toronto Workshop on
Reproducibility.

The second lecture was more interactive. The presentation mostly consisted of
updated slides from the [UserR! 2020 tutorial](#user-2020). Since it was short
and mostly unchanged, I didn't create a shareable link for it.

### R/Medicine

This presentation was a virtual poster. The dimensions had to be A0, and we were
encouraged to create a single slide like a traditional poster. However, this was
very hard to read in the SpatialChat platform, so I also included extra slides
after the initial poster to walk through each section separately.
